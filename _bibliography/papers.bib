  abstract={We detail a recent result on a Carleson measure condition for elliptic measures in 1-sided chord arc domains to belong to the A<sub>\infty</sub> class of Muckenhoupt weights. This was a mini-thesis written for the special topic course on Regularity Theory for Uniformly Elliptic Operators at ANU, supervised by Joseph Feneuil.},
